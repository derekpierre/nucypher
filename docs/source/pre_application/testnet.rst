Ibex Testnet
=============

NuCypher provides a public testnet running on the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet meant for staking providers and node operators
to learn how to set up a PRE application node, as well as for internal development purposes.

The Threshold Token (T) contract address for the testnet is ``0xc3871E2C11Ff18d809Bce74d1e4229d561aa3F09``.
You can view it on `etherscan <https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xc3871e2c11ff18d809bce74d1e4229d561aa3f09>`_.

.. attention::

    This testnet is currently being migrated to Threshold Network.
